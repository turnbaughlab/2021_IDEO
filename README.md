# IDEO
Knitted R files for IDEO analysis
These are pertinent analysis files for the IDEO cohort manuscript Ang, Alba, Upadhyay et. al.
Of note, there are data processing files including for 16S ASV selection and humann2/metaphlan2 gene and species assignments that were run on our local computing cluster. If for some reason those files are required, our laboratory can be contacted to share them.
