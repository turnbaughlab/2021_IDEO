# IDEO
Knitted R files for IDEO analysis
These are pertinent analysis files for the IDEO cohort manuscript Ang, Alba, Upadhyay et. al. These files were used to process the outputs 16S ASV selection by QIIME and humann2/metaphlan2 gene and species assignments that were run on our local computing cluster. If for some reason those files are required, our laboratory can be contacted to share them (run on lab pipelines during 11/2020). A google API key is required to utilize the GGMap tool that was part of this analysis. The API key has since been deleted and cannot be used. A google API key can be generated following instructions (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key). A machine readable extended metadata table is inlcuded in this as was requested during the review process for this manuscript. This table complements the metadata tables referenced in the main text and supplemental tables of the original manuscript.
